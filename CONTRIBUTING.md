## Setting up a development environment

For setting up a wordpress development environment we recommend a Vagrant setup.

Please follow these steps

1. Install [VirtualBox 5.1.x](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

2. Install [Vagrant 1.8.x](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
		* `vagrant`command should now be available through your CLI (you can try running `vagrant -v` to check your installed version)

3. Clone or download the [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) project into a local directory by running `git clone git://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV.git vagrant-local`

4. Change directory throught the command line interface to be inside the `vagrant-local` directory

5. Run your vagrant machine by running `vagrant up` through the command line
		* this will setup your vagrant machine. Please be patient as this step may take some time as vagrant will download and install all of the required files 

6. Add an `192.168.50.4 local.wordpress.dev` entry to your `hosts` file

You should now be able to reach your Wordpress installation by visiting [local.wordpress.dev](http://local.wordpress.dev)

**LOGIN CREDENTIALS** :
